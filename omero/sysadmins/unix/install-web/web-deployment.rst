OMERO.web installation
======================

OMERO.web is a Python client of the OMERO platform that provides a
web-based UI and JSON API.
This section provides guidance on how to install and set up OMERO.web on
any of the supported UNIX and UNIX-like platforms. Specific walkthroughs are
provided for several systems, with detailed step-by-step instructions.
OMERO.web is installed **separately** from the OMERO.server.

OMERO.web can be deployed with:

-  `WSGI <https://wsgi.readthedocs.org>`_ using a WSGI capable web server
   such as
   `NGINX <https://nginx.org/>`_ and `Gunicorn <https://docs.gunicorn.org/>`_
-  the built-in Django lightweight development server (for **testing**
   only; see the :doc:`/developers/Web/Deployment` page)

If you need help configuring your firewall rules, see
:doc:`/sysadmins/server-security` for more details.

If you have installed NGINX, OMERO can automatically generate a
configuration file for your webserver. The location of the file will depend
on your system, please refer to your webserver's manual. See
:ref:`customizing_your_omero_web_installation` for additional
customization options.

Depending upon which platform you are using, you may find a
more specific walkthrough listed below.

.. note:: Support for Apache deployment has been dropped in 5.3.0.
    
    If your organization's policies only allow Apache to be used as the external-facing web-server you should configure Apache to proxy connections to an NGINX instance running on your OMERO server i.e. use Apache as a reverse proxy. For more details see
    `Apache mod_proxy documentation <https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy.html>`_.

This guide uses the example of deploying OMERO.web with
`NGINX <https://nginx.org/>`_ and `Gunicorn <https://docs.gunicorn.org/>`_.

.. _omero_web_deployment:

Prerequisites
-------------

-  Python 3

-  A `WSGI <https://wsgi.readthedocs.org>`_-capable webserver such as
   `NGINX <https://nginx.org/>`_ and `Gunicorn <https://docs.gunicorn.org/>`_


If possible, install the following packages:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 1,8

    * - System
      - Package

    * - Debian
      - python3 nginx

    * - Homebrew
      - python nginx

    * - RedHat
      - python3 nginx

Installation
------------

From **OMERO 5.6.0** release, the ``omero-web`` library supports Python 3 and
can be installed via ``pip``.

We assume the following::

    $ omero_user_web_dir=/opt/omero/web
    $ export OMERODIR=${omero_user_web_dir}/omero-web

We recommend you use a virtual environment::

    $ python3 -m venv ${omero_user_web_dir}/venv3
    $ ${omero_user_web_dir}/venv3/pip install omero-web

.. _gunicorn_default_configuration:

Gunicorn configuration
----------------------

Additional settings can be configured by changing the following properties:

- :property:`omero.web.wsgi_workers` to (2 x NUM_CORES) + 1

  .. note::
      **Do not** scale the number of workers to the number of clients
      you expect to have. OMERO.web should only need 4-12 worker
      processes to handle many requests per second.

- :property:`omero.web.wsgi_args` Additional arguments. For more details
  check `Gunicorn Documentation <https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html>`_.

.. _omero_web_nginx_configuration:

NGINX configuration
-------------------

OMERO can automatically generate a
configuration file for your web server. The location of the file
will depend on your system, please refer to your webserver's manual.
See :ref:`customizing_your_omero_web_installation`
for additional customization options.

To create a site configuration file for inclusion in a system-wide NGINX
configuration redirect the output of the following command into a file:

::

    $ omero web config nginx

.. literalinclude:: nginx-omero.conf


For production servers you may need to add additional directives to the
configuration file, for example to enable
`HTTPS <https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html>`_.
As an alternative to manually modifying the generated file you can generate
a minimal configuration:

::

    $ omero web config nginx-location > ${omero_user_home_dir}/omero-web-location.include

.. literalinclude:: omero-web-location.include


and include this in your own manually created NGINX file, such as
:file:`/etc/nginx/conf.d/omero-web.conf`.


This requires more initial work but in the future you can automatically
regenerate your OMERO.web configuration and your additional configuration
settings will still apply.


.. note::
    If you need help configuring your firewall rules, see the
    :doc:`/sysadmins/server-security` page.



Running OMERO.web
-----------------

Start the Gunicorn worker processes listening by default on 127.0.0.1:4080:

::

    $ omero web start
    ... static files copied to '/opt/omero/web/omero-web/lib/python/omeroweb/static'.
    Starting OMERO.web... [OK]

The Gunicorn workers are managed **separately** from other OMERO
processes. You can check their status or stop them using the
following commands:

::

    $ omero web status
    OMERO.web status... [RUNNING] (PID 59217)
    $ omero web stop
    Stopping OMERO.web... [OK]
    Django WSGI workers (PID 59217) killed.

.. _trial_download_limitation:

Download limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to offer users the ability to download data from OMERO.web you have
to deploy using :ref:`async_workers`.
OMERO.web is able to handle multiple clients on a single worker
thread switching context as necessary while streaming binary data from
OMERO.server. Depending on the traffic and scale of the repository you should
configure connections and speed limits on your server to avoid blocking
resources. We recommend you run benchmark and performance tests.
It is also possible to apply :ref:`download_restrictions` and
offer alternative access to binary data.

.. note::
    Handling streaming request/responses requires proxy buffering
    to be turned off. For more details refer to
    `Gunicorn deployment <https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/deploy.html>`_
    and
    `NGINX configuration <https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_buffering>`_.

.. note::
    :property:`omero.web.application_server.max_requests` should be set to 0

Troubleshooting
---------------

In order to identify why OMERO.web is not available run:

::

    $ omero web status


Then consult NGINX :file:`error.log` and :file:`/home/omero/omero/var/log/OMEROweb.log`

Check :ref:`troubleshooting-omeroweb` for more details.


Debugging
^^^^^^^^^

To run the WSGI server in debug mode, enable
`Gunicorn logging <https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#logging>`_
using :property:`omero.web.wsgi_args`:

::

    $ omero config set omero.web.wsgi_args -- "--log-level=DEBUG --error-logfile=/opt/omero/web/omero-web/var/log/error.log".


.. _gunicorn_advance_configuration:

EXPERIMENTAL: Gunicorn advanced configuration
---------------------------------------------

.. note:: The following configuration options marked as **EXPERIMENTAL** have yet to be extensively tested in a
    production environment, use at your own risk.


OMERO.web deployment can be configured with sync and async workers.
Sync workers are faster and recommended for a data repository with
:ref:`download_restrictions`. If you wish to offer users the ability
to download data then you have to use async workers; read more about
:ref:`trial_download_limitation` above.

See
`Gunicorn design <https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/design.html>`_ for more details.


EXPERIMENTAL: Sync workers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Install :pypi:`futures` ::

      $ pip install futures

Additional settings can be configured by changing the following properties:

- The number of worker threads for handling requests, see
  `Gunicorn threads <https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#threads>`_ ::

      $ omero config set omero.web.wsgi_worker_class
      $ omero config set omero.web.wsgi_threads $(2-4 x NUM_CORES)

.. _async_workers:

EXPERIMENTAL: Async workers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Install `Gevent >= 0.13 <http://www.gevent.org/>`_ ::

      $ pip install "gevent>=0.13"

Additional settings can be configured by changing the following properties:

- The maximum number of simultaneous clients, see
  `Gunicorn worker-connections <https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#worker-connections>`_ ::

      $ omero config set omero.web.wsgi_worker_class gevent
      $ omero config set omero.web.wsgi_worker_connections 1000
      $ omero config set omero.web.application_server.max_requests 0
