System Administrator Documentation

This documentation begins with information aimed at OS-level administrators
and moves on to day-to-day management of OMERO for facility managers (who may
find it useful to read the
:help:`Facility Managers help guide <facility-manager.html>` for an overview
first).

Installation
************

This section provides guidance on how to install and set up OMERO.server
and OMERO.web on any of the supported UNIX and UNIX-like platforms.
Following the installation links below you will find specific walkthroughs
provided for several systems, with detailed step-by-step instructions.
Reading through the :doc:`unix/server-installation` and
:doc:`unix/install-web/web-deployment` pages first
is recommended as this explains the entire process rather than just being a
series of commands.

Managing OMERO
**************

This section contains details on how to manage users, groups and data access
in OMERO. New in OMERO 5.4.0, full administrators can now create restricted
administrators to allow facility managers or other trusted users to carry out
tasks on behalf of all users.
